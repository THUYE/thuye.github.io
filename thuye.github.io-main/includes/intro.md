# About Me

 I am an Assistant Professor at Weill Cornell Medicine and a faculty advisor for the Electrical & Computer Engineering Program at Northwestern University. I am intersted in the intersection of clinical and medical informatics, population health, and health equity. My research efforts encompass three areas: 1) leveraging large cohort, clinical informatics, phenotyping, large language models, and big data harmonization methods and tools to study the patients' health states across the life course in vulnerable populations worldwide; 2) applying digital health and health information technology to improve health care equity; and 3) using data science and implementation research to contextualize, evaluate, scale, and increase the impact of evidence-based interventions across diverse global settings.
